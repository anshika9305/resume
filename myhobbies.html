    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <p>I’ve always enjoyed spending my free time doing things that make me feel happy and relaxed. Music is a big part of my life—I love listening to different genres depending on my mood. Dancing is another hobby I really enjoy; it helps me express myself and have fun.Along with that, I also like sketching and taking random aesthetic photos whenever something catches my eye. Sometimes, I just enjoy writing in my journal. These little things help me stay creative and bring me peace in my everyday life.
